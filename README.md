# ImGuiApp

This is a minimal starter template for using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) — a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++ — set up with CMake and minimal dependencies.

The goal of this project is to learn and build an application from the ground up. Using the foundational framework provided here, you can skip boilerplate setup and begin adding new features such as:

- 🎮 Physics simulation
- 🎨 Texture swapping
- 📦 Object insertion and transformation
- 🎛️ GUI-based object control
- 🧠 Game logic and behavior scripting
- 🎲 And much more advanced systems!

## Pre-Requisites

Since this uses a wide range of systems behind the scenes having a strong foundation of the following would prove very useful:

- Cmake uses and integration
- General C++ development background
- Low level graphic programming

## Install

```
	 git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Dra9on123/ImGuiApp.git
	 cd ImGuiApp
	 git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Acknowledgements

If you need help with anything just message me on Discord (razour) and I'll respond as soon as possible. Thank you for taking interest in the project thus far!
